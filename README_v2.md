# EnergyShield (ICCPS '23, Submission 251)

EnergyShield is a framework for provably-safe offloading of neural network controllers at the edge. Energy comprises two offloading modes: eager and uniform, both of which are compared in our paper againts the continuous local execution for the use-case of autonomous driving using the Carla simulator.
<!-- It is described in the enclosed submission ICCPS_2023.pdf, hereafter referred to as [EnergyShield-ICCPS2023] -->

This README describes how to replicate the results in [EnergyShield-ICCPS2023] using the code supplied in this virtual machine. This includes generating new experimental data from new Carla simulation instances and creating plots for three numerical experiments:

	(Experiment 1) Energy Efficiency and Safety Evaluation of EnergyShield through Carla Simulation runs (Section 5.2)
	(Experiment 2) Performance Gains from EnergyShield given wireless channel variation (Section 5.3)
	(Experiment 3) Generality to other neural network controllers (Section 5.4) 

We remark that for the evaluator's convenience, we added a directory containing the original results in our paper under `./paper_results` to facilitate comparison's with the generated results from the users' test cases.

## 2. Setup

<!-- ### Model checkpoints and Excel files
- To reuse our pretrained models in generating new results, download from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ryR7FuCEwSy5KiOBlVQQ5OpPMQEEZdXn/view?usp=sharing) and unzip in the main EnergyShield to have the models data under directory `./EnergyShield/models/` 

Our main experimental model and results is named "casc_agent_1". We created another instance of it "casc_agent_1_new" to allow users to generate their own test runs using the same model checkpoint. The rest of the models in the directory are the ones used to construct Table 1. Each model folder (e.g., `./EnergyShield/models/casc_agent_1/`) should contain a subfolder for the checkpoint and another for its experimental data.  -->

## 3. Experiment 1 - Energy Efficiency and Safety Evaluation
As per the description in 5.2, we provide the script to initiate new Carla simulation runs that compare the performance of EnergyShield (with both its eager and uniform modes) to the conventional local execution mode with regards to energy efficiency and safety. 

Users can generate their own test results using our pretrained model using the following script:
```Bash
# Experiment 1 Carla simulation
./scripts/run_exp1.sh `num_eps` 
```
<!-- `model` is the name of the pretrained model directory(default: "casc_agent_1_new"). Users do not need to alter this argument for it indicates new simulation experiments using our pretrained RL model. -->
`num_eps` is an optional argument describing the number of episodes per experimental configuration (default: 3). Note that although `num_eps` in our paper was 35, we kept it here at 3 to speed up the simulation runs for the evaluators. From our experience, running the script with `num_eps` set to 3 takes around 1 hour of computation time on a workstation with 32 GB RAM and NVIDA GPU 2070 RTX super. 

Once the simulations terminate, raw data generated by carla simulations are copied to `../results/raw_data/`. The raw data provides information and statistics on the agent's performance based on its driving and offloading decisions. For convenience, we provide a description of the file hierarchy and what each data field represents in this readme's appendix. 

Afterwards, fgures 5, 6, and 7 can be generated in .pdf formt based on the raw data in the below paths. We remark the following:
- Figure 6 trajectories are generated based on 3 random episodes from the user's generated files. The figure may not possess the same driving patterns as ours for it depends on the RL agent's driving decisions (For instance, in an extreme corner cases, vehicle's trajectory can be a point indicating the RL agent remained stationary)
- Figure 7 (Energy vs. distance) is generated based on statistical representation of raw data in `../results/distance/*.csv` - also described in the appendix. 

The figures can be found under the following paths:

	../results/Fig5_Energy.pdf
	../results/Fig5_Safety.pdf
	../results/Fig6_traj_noise_False.pdf
	../results/Fig6_traj_noise_True.pdf
	../results/Fig7_Ergy_v_dist.pdf

## 4. Experiment 2 - Performance under wireless channel variation
In 5.3, Additional Carla simulations are conducted to evaluate EnergyShield's resilience under variations of wireless network conditions, which are represented in this paper by the parameters of channel throughput and queuing delays. To run these additional simulations, users can run the following script:
```Bash
# Experiment 2 Carla simulations
./scripts/run_exp2.sh `num_eps`
```
`num_eps` is the same argument from experiment 1 (default:3). This script will instantiate 5 additional experiments of varying wireless conditions. Once the simulations are terminated, their corresponding raw data files are copied to `../results/raw_data`, which are then used to generate the box and whisker plots of Figures 8 and 9 describing additional offloading windows (%) and the normalized energy consumption (w.r.t local execution) under different wireless conditions: 
<!-- ```Bash
# Experiment 2 Figures' Generation
sh ./scripts/exp2_generate_results.sh
``` -->
	../results/Fig8_windows.pdf
	../results/Fig9_energy.pdf

## 5. Experiment 3 - Performance Statistics

This last script generates a `.csv` file describing the performance statistics of the user's model in accordance with the metrics in Table 1. These performance metrics are the average center deviance (CD), Track Completion Rate (TCR), and average energy consumption (E) based on the generated results from the users' experiments as follows: 
```Bash
# Experiment 3 generate model statistics
./scripts/exp3_generate_results.sh
```
The results will be displayed in the terminal and saved in `.csv` format under the path `../results/stats_for_casc_agent_1_new.csv`. 

<!-- can be set to one of {"casc_agent_1", "casc_agent_2", "casc_agent_3", "casc_agent_4"} to genreate our exact numbers. -->

## Appendix

Raw Data

Under `../results/raw_data/`, every directory describes the evaluation results for a set of episodes. The name suffix of each directory describes the experimental configuration setting these evaluations belong to. For instance: 

- Directory `Town04_OPT_ResNet152_Shield2_early`: experiment1 evaluations for EnergyShield early mode at default wireless settings
- Directory `Town04_OPT_ResNet152_Shield2_belay_10Mbps`: experiment2 evaluations for EnergyShield uniform mode when varying wireless channel throughput to 10Mbps

Within each of these directories, four subdirectories exist to describe whether the experiments were conduceted with/without gaussian noise and with/without safety filter activated. In each one of these subdirectories, we can find the experimental data in `*.csv` format as follows: 
-	`plots/*.csv` files containing the individual episodal data incurred by the carla simulator when running each episode for the corresponding experimental setting.
-	`valid_data.csv` is the file describing the final statistics for every episode within the corresponding experimental configuration

Information in the former include simulation time, position, steering angle, relative obstacle position, wireless conditions, safety time window, offloading actions, and performance evaluations in terms of latency and energy - all calculated instanteously for every simulation tick. 

Information in the latter include statistics for each episode about total number of ticks, reward, distance travelled, speed, average latency, average energy per inference, average center deviance, and whether the agent has hit an obstacle/curb.

Distance data

For figure 7 (normalized energy variation vs distance (meters)), raw data is used to construct the tables in `../results/distance/*.csv` which aggregate average normalized energy consumption and #occurrences across 1 m increments of 'distance from obstacle' parameter from all episodes within the subdirectory. Each of these tables is then used to construct a plot from the figure describing how this relation varies under different experimental settings.
