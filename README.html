        <h1 id="energyshield-iccps-23-submission-251">EnergyShield (ICCPS '23, Submission 251)</h1>
<p>EnergyShield is an Autonomous Driving System framework designed to save energy on-vehicle by wirelessly offloading NN computations to edge computers, while at the same time maintaining a formal guarantee of safety. In particular, EnergyShield uses a barrier function/controller shield to provide provably safe edge response times for NN offloading requests; on vehicle evaluation provides a safety fallback.</p>
<p>EnergyShield is described in the paper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>EnergyShield: Provably-Safe Offloading of Neural Network Controllers for Energy Efficiency.</em><br>
Mohanad Odema, James Ferlez, Goli Vaisi, Yasser Shoukry and Mohammad Abdullah Al Faruque. ICCPS 2023: 14th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which is appended to this document, and hereafter referred to as [ES23].</p>
<p>[ES23] contains a number of experiments showing the efficacy of EnergyShield in the <a href="https://carla.org">Carla</a> simulation environment. This README describes how to replicate those results using code packaged in a <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/">Docker</a> image. In particular, this artifact reruns from scratch the following experiments from [ES23]:</p>

<h2 id="3-experiment-1---energy-efficiency-and-safety-evaluation">3. Experiment 1 - Energy Efficiency and Safety Evaluation</h2>
<p>In this experiment, we compared EnergyShield with purely on-vehicle NN controller evaluation, both in terms of energy consumption and safety; see [ES23], Section 5.2. This comparison was made using a single RL-trained NN controller driving a fixed track; safety entails avoiding randomly spawned stationary obstacles along this track. This artifact reuses the same track and NN controller from our experiment, but the obstacle locations and instantaneous wireless-link performance are randomized.</p>
<p>To rerun this experiment, ensure that you have an EnergyShield container running (see <a href="#iii-starting-a-docker-container">Section 2 <em>(iii)</em></a>), and execute the following commands in the <strong>container</strong>'s bash shell:</p>

<!-- `model` is the name of the pretrained model directory(default: "casc_agent_1_new"). Users do not need to alter this argument for it indicates new simulation experiments using our pretrained RL model. -->
<p><code>NUM_EPS</code> is an optional argument specifying the number of episodes to run (default: <code>NUM_EPS=3</code>); an episode is defined as one run of the fixed track until either the vehicle completes the track or hits an obstacle. For [ES23], we ran this experiment for 35 episodes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong>  Running this script with the default <code>NUM_EPS=3</code>  takes around 1 hour on a workstation with 32 GB RAM and NVIDIA GPU 2070 RTX super.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> When the script finishes, you will be returned to a shell prompt in the container (see <a href="#iii-starting-a-docker-container">Section 2 <em>(iii)</em></a>). If the script is successfully running, status information will be output to the console regularly.</p>

<p>Their filenames match them to the figures that appear in [ES23]. For reference, the figures from [ES23] are also available with the same filenames in <code>$ES_PATH/paper_results</code>.</p>
<p>This script also outputs the raw Carla simulation data of each episode (i.e. the simulation time-stamped positions, control actions, etc. of the vehicle); this data is placed in <code>$ES_PATH/container_results/raw_data</code>; the analogous raw data from our simulations can be found in <code>$ES_PATH/paper_results/raw_data</code> for comparison. The format and structure of this data is described in the subsequent <a href="#6-appendix">Appendix</a>.</p>

<h2 id="4-experiment-2---performance-under-wireless-channel-variation">4. Experiment 2 - Performance under wireless channel variation</h2>
<p>In this experiment, we evaluated the energy savings provided by EnergyShield as a function of different wireless-link conditions to the edge; see [ES23], Section 5.3. This experiment uses mostly the same setup as Experiment 1, including the same NN controller and track. However, in this experiment, batches of episodes are run under five different simulated wireless-link conditions. As before, this artifact reuses the same track and NN controller from our experiment, but the obstacle locations and instantaneous wireless-link performance are randomized.</p>
<!-- In 5.3, Additional Carla simulations are conducted to evaluate EnergyShield's resilience under variations of wireless network conditions, which are represented in this paper by the parameters of channel throughput and queuing delays.

<p>The primary outputs of this script are a collection of <code>*.CSV</code> files containing summary data for each agent, as reported in Table 1 of [ES23]. This data includes average center deviance (CD), Track Completion Rate (TCR) and average energy consumption (E). These files are output as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Bash"><span class="hljs-variable">$ES_PATH</span>/container_results/stats_for_casc_agent_1_new.csv

</code></pre>
<p>The number in each file name matches the data to the corresponding Controller 1 through 4 as indicated in Table 1. Since Controller 1 was used in <a href="#3-experiment-1---energy-efficiency-and-safety-evaluation">Experiment 1</a>, the summary data in <code>stats_for_casc_agent_1_new.csv</code> is derived from the output of <code>run_exp1.sh</code>.</p>
<p>The raw data for each additional agent is likewise output to <code>$ES_PATH/container_results/raw_data</code>, with one folder for each of these additional agents. See the <a href="#6-appendix">Appendix</a> for a description of the structure and format of this data.</p>
<h2 id="6-appendix">6. Appendix</h2>
<p>Raw Data</p>
<p>Under <code>$ES_PATH/container_results/raw_data/</code>, every directory describes the evaluation results for a set of episodes. The name suffix of each directory describes the experimental configuration setting these evaluations belong to. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Directory <code>Town04_OPT_ResNet152_Shield2_early</code>: experiment1 evaluations for EnergyShield early mode at default wireless settings</li>
<li>Directory <code>Town04_OPT_ResNet152_Shield2_belay_10Mbps</code>: experiment2 evaluations for EnergyShield uniform mode when varying wireless channel throughput to 10Mbps</li>
</ul>
<p>Within each of these directories, four subdirectories exist to describe whether the experiments were conducted with/without gaussian noise and with/without safety filter activated. In each one of these subdirectories, we can find the experimental data in <code>*.csv</code> format as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>plots/*.csv</code> files containing the individual episode's data incurred by the carla simulator when running each episode for the corresponding experimental setting.</li>
<li><code>valid_data.csv</code> is the file describing the final statistics for every episode within the corresponding experimental configuration</li>
</ul>
<p>Information in the former include simulation time, position, steering angle, relative obstacle position, wireless conditions, safety time window, offloading actions, and performance evaluations in terms of latency and energy - all calculated instantaneously for every simulation tick.</p>
<p>Information in the latter include statistics for each episode about total number of ticks, reward, distance traveled, speed, average latency, average energy per inference, average center deviance, and whether the agent has hit an obstacle/curb.</p>
<p>Distance data</p>
<p>For figure 7 (normalized energy variation vs distance (meters)), raw data is used to construct the tables in <code>$ES_PATH/container_results/distance/*.csv</code> which aggregate average normalized energy consumption and #occurrences across 1 m increments of 'distance from obstacle' parameter from all episodes within the subdirectory. Each of these tables is then used to construct a plot from the figure describing how this relation varies under different experimental settings.</p>
